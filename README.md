- this is a python recreation of the famous word game "wordle"
- it uses the tkinter and configparser packages, and is built using pyinstaller
- includes themes!

# future goals
- add options for different word lengths (requires separate dictionaries for each length)
- give themes optional values to control all of the colors used in the program
